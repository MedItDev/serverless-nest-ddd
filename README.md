## Installation

To run the project, a `Node` environment of at least version `16.17.0 (LTS)` is required.

In addition, a global installation of the [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/) framework is required

```bash
  npm install -g serverless pnpm

```

We then clone the repo and go inside it, then install the dependencies

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:MedItDev/serverless-nest-ddd.git

  cd serverless-nest-ddd.git

  pnpm install
```

The final step is to launch the project with the command

```bash
  serverless offline start
```
